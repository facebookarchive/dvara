exmongodb - Extensible MongoDB [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mcuadros/exmongodb.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mcuadros/exmongodb)
==============================

The main goal of exmongodb is provide a way to extend mongodb with new features. Currently this project is more a experiment than a serious one.

exmongodb is based on the great work of [Naitik Shah](https://github.com/daaku) in [dvara](https://github.com/facebookgo/dvara) a connection pooling proxy for mongodb.
